Why should you measure and report the time that is required to complete the different phases of an investigation?
- to decrease the time to remediate the incident
- to determine the dwell time and measure the SOC's efficiency

- all the compromised assets
- the amount of time spent on analysis of log data

Static malware analysis detection tools mainly use which two methods to determine if a file is malicious or benign? (Choose two.)
- the file's metadata
- sandbox to execute the file to determine its behaviors
- compress (pack) the file to de-obfuscate it
- forensic indicators about the file

Examining the logs from an Identity Access Management system, such as Cisco ISE, what four pieces of information are crucial to the SOC analyst? (Choose four.)
- which user has logged into a particular host
- what operating system a particular host is running
- what device the user used to access a particular host
- whether or not a particular host has the required security posture (antivirus, firewall, and so on)

- the file's metadata
- **sandbox to execute the file to determine its behaviors**
- compress (pack) the file to de-obfuscate it
- forensic indicators about the file

If the malicious ObliqueRAT is not detected using an antivirus program at the endpoint, what can Snort IPS, a network-based detection tool, use to detect it?

- Snort rules detect the malicious ObliqueRAT hash.
- Snort rules detect the ObliqueRAT lateral movement attempts.
- Snort rules detect the ObliqueRAT privilege escalation attempts.

What is the file’s magic number?
- **the first part of a file to uniquely identify the type of file**
- the hash value of the file
- a reference to the file’s mutex
- the file’s fingerprint
